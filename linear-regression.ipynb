    "# Predicting BigMart Sales\n",
    "Provided by Analytics Vidhya, we have been participating in the BigMart Sales Practice Problem which began on May 25th, 2016, and ends on December 31st, 2018. Data scientists at BigMart have “collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities”, which participants will use to build a model to predict product sales by store. With this, BigMart will try to gain understanding of product and store properties that lead to increased sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data to increase profitability is now an intuitive and common practice in business; the type, number, and even physical placement of products is no longer arbitrary, rather, it is determined by data. Therefore, this study echoes the common business approach to increasing profitability: data-driven decision making.\n"

Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.”_\n"

    "1. Item visibility affects the sale of the product\n",
    "    Ex: the more exposed the item, the more sales it produces\n",
    "2. Outlet size and outlet location type affects the profitability of a store\n",
    " Ex: the larger the store, the more profits\n",
    "3. Profitability of a store is dependent on the product(s) it offers and its location\n",
    "4. Item that is placed at bigger shelf or shelf with height of average people is more likely catch customers’ attention and thus should have more sales\n",
    "5. Outlet with longer history is more likely to have higher profitability because it has impacted for the area for longer time\n",
    "6. Stores that are located in tier 1 cities or urban areas should have higher sales because people who live in these areas tend to have higher levels of income"
